# Antex-XM100-Control
Proof of concept HTML/JS page to control the Antex Electronics XM-100 XM Satellite Radio Tuner via serial RS-232 commands.  *Completely vibe coded*

I had an old XM-100 device I wanted to control by RS-232.  I couldn't find any command references online, but I had some souce code of an older program used to control the device.  I used CoPilot to determine the command structure from the source code, and ChatGPT to make the webpage.  Working currently (9/2025) in MS Edge, with a Trendnet TU-S9 v1 USB to Serial Converter with older drivers installed (see https://github.com/theAmberLion/Prolific).
